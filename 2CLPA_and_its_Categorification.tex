\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we explore the 2-cyclic quiver Laurent polynomial algebra and its categorification. Inspired by the framework of cluster algebras, the study begins by introducing the concept of 2-cyclic quivers and their mutation. We define 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebra is established and prove that the Laurent monomial phenomenon behaved on 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebra. We further classify 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebras in the finite type case and extends essential concepts from cluster algebras, such as $c$-vectors, $g$-vectors, and $F$-polynomials, to the 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebra framework, as a consequence, We prove the sign-coherence of $c$-vectors of 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebra.. Moreover, we establish the connections between 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebras and cluster algebras.

We also expand the Derksen-Weyman-Zelevinsky theory of quivers with potential to the 2-cyclic quivers. A mutation theory for 2-cyclic quivers with potentials is developed, and we prove that the mutation is an involution and that finite-dimensionality is a mutation invariant. Additionally, we show the existence of a well-behaved Jacobian-finite potential for the $\bA_n$-type 2-cyclic quiver, and furthermore, proves that the potential is also non-degenerate when $n \leq 3$.

In the final part of this thesis, combining the theory of  generalized cluster categories, the thesis investigates the generalized cluster category of a 2-cyclic quiver with potential of $\bA_n$-type. By constructing the corresponding covering functor over the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-cover of the 2-cyclic quiver with potential, the reachable cluster tilting objects are identified. In addition, we introduce the definition of  2-cyclic Caldero-Chapoton (CC) formula:
\begin{equation}
CC(X)=X^{-\fg_X}\sum_{e\in\bN^n}\chi\bigl(\Gr_e(H^0(X))\bigr)y^e,
\end{equation}
and it is proven that this map categorifies the $g$-vectors of the $\bA_n$-type 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebra, ensuring that the $\bA_n$-type generalized cluster category is cluster-tilting finite. For the categorification of the $F$-polynomials of 2-cyclic Laurent polynomial algebras, we prove that the F-polynomials of indecomposable $\tau$-rigid modules for $\bA_n$-type Jacobian algebras correspond to the $F$-polynomials of the associated 2-cyclic quiver when $n \leq 3$.
