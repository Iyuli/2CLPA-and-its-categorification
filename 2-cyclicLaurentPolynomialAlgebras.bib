We prove that there exists a potential on these quivers that ensures the resulting quiver with potential is Jacobian-finite. As an application, we first demonstrate, using covering theory, that a Jacobian-finite potential exists on a class of 2-acyclic quivers. Secondly, by using the 2-cyclic Caldero-Chapoton formula, the \${\textbackslash}tau\$-rigid modules over the Jacobian algebras of our proven Jacobian-finite 2-cyclic quiver with potential can categorify Paquette-Schiffler's generalized cluster algebras in three specific cases: one for a disk with two marked points and one 3-puncture, one for a sphere with one puncture, one 3-puncture and one orbifold point, and another for a sphere with one puncture and two 3-punctures.},

These two questions are closely related. One consequence of our investigation is to find an algorithm to compute the canonical decomposition of an arbitrary dimension vector in terms of the Euler form of the quiver. We may also compute the dimension vectors of subrepresentations of a general representation and the minimal dimension of Ext(R, S) as R and S run through representations of dimension vectors α and β respectively.},

Finally, we compute the coordinate action of the mapping class group on the total space; the total space is found to have a rich (equivariant) geometric structure. We sketch some connections with arithmetic groups, diophantine approximations, and certain problems in plane euclidean geometry. Furthermore, these investigations lead to an explicit scheme of integration over the moduli spaces, and to the construction of a “universal Teichmüller space,” which we hope will provide a formalism for understanding some connections between the Teichmüller theory, the KP hierarchy and the Virasoro algebra.

For group actions on cluster algebras from surfaces, we describe the generalized cluster structure of the orbit space in terms of a triangulated orbifold. In this case, we give a complete list of exchange polynomials, and we classify the algebras of rank 1 and 2. We also show that every admissible group action on a cluster category induces a precovering from the cluster category to the cluster category of orbits. Moreover this precovering is dense if the categories are of finite type.},

Furthermore, we show that any two tagged triangulations are related by a sequence of flips compatible with QP-mutation. We also prove that, for each of the QPs constructed, the ideal of the non-completed path algebra generated by the cyclic derivatives is admissible and the corresponding quotient is isomorphic to the Jacobian algebra. These results, which generalize some of the second author’s previous work for ideal triangulations, are then applied to prove properties of cluster monomials, like linear independence, in the cluster algebra associated to the given surface by Fomin, Shapiro and Thurston (with an arbitrary system of coefficients).},

We introduce a moduli space P(G,S) parametrizing G-local system on S with some boundary data, and prove that it carries a cluster Poisson structure, equivariant under the action of the cluster modular group M(G,S), containing the mapping class group of S, the group of outer automorphisms of G, and the product of Weyl / braid groups over punctures / boundary components. We prove that the dual moduli space A(G,S) carries a M(G,S)-equivariant cluster structure, and the pair (A(G,S), P(G,S)) is a cluster ensemble. These results generalize the works of V. Fock \& the first author, and of I. Le. We quantize cluster Poisson varieties X for any Planck constant h s.t. h{\textgreater}0 or {\textbar}h{\textbar}=1. First, we define a *-algebra structure on the Langlands modular double A(h; X) of the algebra of functions on X. We construct a principal series of representations of the *-algebra A(h; X), equivariant under a unitary projective representation of the cluster modular group M(X). This extends works of V. Fock and the first author when h{\textgreater}0. Combining this, we get a M(G,S)-equivariant quantization of the moduli space P(G,S), given by the *-algebra A(h; P(G,S)) and its principal series representations. We construct realizations of the principal series *-representations. In particular, when S is punctured disc with two special points, we get a principal series *-representations of the Langlands modular double of the quantum group Uq(g). We conjecture that there is a nondegenerate pairing between the local system of coinvariants of oscillatory representations of the W-algebra and the one provided by the projective representation of the mapping class group of S.},

Representation varieties of the Calabi-Yau algebra are intimately related to the set of critical points, and to the sheaf of vanishing cycles of the potential. Numerical invariants, like ranks of cyclic homology groups, are expected to be given by `matrix integrals' over representation varieties. We discuss examples of Calabi-Yau algebras involving quivers, 3-dimensional McKay correspondence, crepant resolutions, Sklyanin algebras, hyperbolic 3-manifolds and Chern-Simons. Examples related to quantum Del Pezzo surfaces will be discussed in [EtGi].},

	abstract = {We consider a class of line operators in \$d = 4, {\textbackslash}mathcal\{N\} = 2\$ supersymmetric field theories, which leave four supersymmetries unbroken. Such line operators support a new class of BPS states which we call "framed BPS states." These include halo bound states similar to those of \$d = 4, {\textbackslash}mathcal\{N\} = 2\$ supergravity, where (ordinary) BPS particles are loosely bound to the line operator. Using this construction, we give a new proof of the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula (WCF) for the ordinary BPS particles, by reducing it to the semiprimitive WCF. After reducing on \$S{\textasciicircum}1\$, the expansion of the vevs of the line operators in the IR provides a new physical interpretation of the "Darboux coordinates" on the moduli space M of the theory. Moreover, we introduce a "protected spin character" (PSC) that keeps track of the spin degrees of freedom of the framed BPS states. We show that the generating functions of PSCs admit a multiplication, which defines a deformation of the algebra of holomorphic functions on \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{M\}\$. As an illustration of these ideas, we consider the sixdimensional (2, 0) field theory of \$A\_1\$ type compactified on a Riemann surface \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$. Here, we show (extending previous results) that line operators are classified by certain laminations on a suitably decorated version of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{C\}\$, and we compute the spectrum of framed BPS states in several explicit examples. Finally, we indicate some interesting connections to the theory of cluster algebras.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to introduce τ -tilting theory, which ‘completes’ (classical) tilting theory from the viewpoint of mutation. It is well known in tilting theory that an almost complete tilting module for any ﬁnite-dimensional algebra over a ﬁeld k is a direct summand of exactly one or two tilting modules. An important property in clustertilting theory is that an almost complete cluster-tilting object in a 2-CY triangulated category is a direct summand of exactly two cluster-tilting objects. Reformulated for path algebras kQ, this says that an almost complete support tilting module has exactly two complements. We generalize (support) tilting modules to what we call (support) τ -tilting modules, and show that an almost complete support τ -tilting module has exactly two complements for any ﬁnite-dimensional algebra. For a ﬁnite-dimensional k-algebra Λ, we establish bijections between functorially ﬁnite torsion classes in mod Λ, support τ -tilting modules and two-term silting complexes in Kb(proj Λ). Moreover, these objects correspond bijectively to cluster-tilting objects in C if Λ is a 2-CY tilted algebra associated with a 2-CY triangulated category C. As an application, we show that the property of having two complements holds also for two-term silting complexes in Kb(proj Λ).},

In this model, the tilting objects correspond to the clusters of Fomin–Zelevinsky.

As a byproduct, for (arbitrarily punctured) surfaces with non-empty boundary, we obtain a proof of the non-degeneracy of the associated QPs which is independent from the one given by the author in the ﬁrst paper of the series. The main tool used to prove the aforementioned compatibility between ﬂips and QP-mutations is what we have called Popping Theorem, which, roughly speaking, says that an apparent lack of symmetry in the potentials arising from ideal triangulations with self-folded triangles can be ﬁxed by a suitable right-equivalence.},

We show that the exchange graph of a cluster algebra with principal coeﬃcients covers the exchange graph of any cluster algebra with the same exchange matrix. We investigate two families of parameterizations of cluster monomials by lattice points, determined, respectively, by the denominators of their Laurent expansions and by certain multi-gradings in cluster algebras with principal coeﬃcients. The properties of these parameterizations, some proven and some conjectural, suggest links to duality conjectures of Fock and Goncharov. The coeﬃcient dynamics leads to a natural generalization of Zamolodchikov’s Y -systems. We establish a Laurent phenomenon for such Y -systems, previously known in ﬁnite type only, and sharpen the periodicity result from an earlier paper. For cluster algebras of ﬁnite type, we identify a canonical ‘universal’ choice of coeﬃcients such that an arbitrary cluster algebra can be obtained from the universal one (of the same type) by an appropriate specialization of coeﬃcients.},

On the algebraic side, it relies on the notion of a non-normalized cluster algebra and the machinery of tropical lambda lengths. Our model allows for an arbitrary choice of coefficients which translates into a choice of a family of integral laminations on the surface. It provides an intrinsic interpretation of cluster variables as renormalized lambda lengths of arcs on the surface. Exchange relations are written in terms of the shear coordinates of the laminations, and are interpreted as generalized Ptolemy relations for lambda lengths. This approach gives alternative proofs for the main structural results from our previous paper, removing unnecessary assumptions on the surface.},
